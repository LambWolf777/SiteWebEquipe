                Back in 2005, me and my friend Jay decided the world needed a better chess website.
                There were places to play online, but none of them felt like home. We imagined a site where people could
                build
                their chess home online and all in one place: to play in a safe and friendly environment, find friends,
                save
                their games, tell their chess stories, share ideas, and learn from each other.
                was mid-way through a graduate degree at Stanford and all of my classmates were taking jobs in finance
                or hot
                tech companies. But I turned down job offers (including Facebook!) to follow the dream of building the
                greatest
                chess site the world had ever seen. And I convinced Jay’s wife to let him join me! Luckily enough, we
                found out
                that “chess.com” was coming available in a bankruptcy auction, and we bought the name.

                Over the next several years, Jay and I poured our life savings, our hearts, and most of our waking hours
                into
                building Chess.com. But we never imagined what it is today!
